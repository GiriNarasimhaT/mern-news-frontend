# mern-news-frontend

Live at : https://mernnewsapp.netlify.app/

Backend code repository : https://github.com/GiriNarasimhaT/mern-news-backend

Features need to be added :
1. Email verification
2. Password resetting using email
3. Image uploads to amazon s3 bucket, as render.com [where the backend code is hosted] doesn't allow disk storage for free tier.

Note : Article cover images and the user's profile pictures will not be seen after some time of uploading because of the above mentioned reason.
whereas the article content images would be visible as they are being stored in database, but this would increase the response time.
